# How to create a custom XtraMessageBox with the extended functionality

## This example is obsolete and starting with version 18.1 this task can be accomplished out of the box

Starting with version *15.2*, we implemented the **XtraMessageBoxArgs.Showing** event that is designed to customize the dialog form before it is shown. This allows you to disable/enable buttons, specify the form's start position etc.
Also, in version *18.1*, we introduced the **Auto Close** feature for the **XtraMessageBox** dialog. Use the **XtraMessageBoxArgs.AutoCloseOptions** to customize it.
